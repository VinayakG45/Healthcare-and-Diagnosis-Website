                <p>Respiratory diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary
                    fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer. Also called lung disorder and pulmonary disease.</p>
                <p>Respiratory diseases, or lung diseases, are pathological conditions affecting the organs and
                    tissues that make gas exchange difficult in air-breathing animals. </p>
                <p>They include conditions of the respiratory tract including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles,
                    alveoli, pleurae, pleural cavity, the nerves and muscles of respiration. </p>
                <p>Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, influenza, and
                    pharyngitis to life-threatening diseases such as bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism,
                    tuberculosis, acute asthma, lung cancer, and severe acute respiratory syndromes, such as
                    COVID-19.</p>
                <p>The study of respiratory disease is known as pulmonology. A physician who specializes in respiratory
                    disease is
                    known as a pulmonologist, a chest medicine specialist, a respiratory medicine specialist, a
                    respirologist or a thoracic medicine specialist.</p>

                include tuberculosis, lung cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), pneumonia, occupational
                lung disease, and smoking. Sleep Health is now a separate topic area of Healthy People 2020.</p>

        <h3>Asthma</h3>
        <p>The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980. However, deaths from asthma have decreased since the
            mid-1990s. The causes of asthma are an active area of research and involve both genetic and environmental
            factors.</p>
        <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by episodes of reversible
            breathing problems due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes can range in severity from
            mild to life threatening. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness
            of breath. Daily preventive treatment can prevent symptoms and attacks and enable individuals who have
            asthma to lead active lives.</p>
        <p>Risk factors for asthma currently being investigated include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Having a parent with asthma</li>
            <li>Sensitization to irritants and allergens</li>
            <li>Respiratory infections in childhood</li>
            <li>Overweight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and
            mortality exist, particularly for low-income and minority populations.</p>

        <h3>COPD</h3>
        <p>COPD is the 4th leading cause of death in the United States. In 2014, approximately 142,000 individuals died
            from COPD, and almost as many died from lung cancer (approximately 155,500) in the same year. In nearly 8
            out of 10 cases, COPD is caused by exposure to cigarette smoke. Other environmental exposures (such as those
            in the workplace) may also cause COPD.</p>

        <p>COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully
            reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory
            response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases (typically from exposure to cigarette smoke).
            Treatment can lessen symptoms and improve quality of life for those with COPD.</p>

        <p>Genetic factors strongly influence the development of the disease. For example, not all smokers develop
            COPD. Quitting smoking may slow the progression of the disease. Women and men are affected equally, yet
            more women than men have died of COPD since 2000.</p>

        <h3>Chronic</h3>
        <p>Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung. Some of the
            most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and
            pulmonary hypertension. In addition to tobacco smoke, other risk factors include air pollution, occupational
            chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood.</p>
        <p>CRDs are not curable, however, various forms of treatment that help dilate major air passages and improve
            shortness of breath can help control symptoms and increase the quality of life for people with the disease.
            The WHO Global Alliance against CRDs (GARD) vision is a world in which all people breathe freely, GARD
            focuses in particular on the needs of people with CRDs in low-income and middle-income countries.</p>

        <p>The aim of the WHO Chronic Respiratory Diseases Programme is to support Member States in their efforts to
            reduce the toll of morbidity, disability and premature mortality related to chronic respiratory diseases,
            and specifically, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>

        <h3>Pneumonia</h3>
        <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid
            or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A
            variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>

        <p>Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young
            children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.</p>
        <p>Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chest pain when you breathe or cough.</li>
            <li>Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older).</li>
            <li>Cough, which may produce phlegm.</li>
            <li>Fever, sweating and shaking chills.</li>
            <li>Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems).
            </li>
            <li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lung Cancer</h3>
        <p>Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that
            take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale.</p>
        <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.</p>
        <p>People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer, though lung cancer can also occur in people who have
            never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes you've
            smoked. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of
            developing lung cancer.</p>
        <p>Signs and symptoms of lung cancer may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new cough that doesn't go away.</li>
            <li>Coughing up blood, even a small amount.</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
            <li>Chest pain.</li>
            <li>Losing weight without trying.</li>
            <li>Hoarseness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Respiratory Disease Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty Breathing:
                <p>While it's common to feel a shortness of breath during exercise, if it doesn't go away—or is present
                    when you aren't exerting yourself—you should be concerned. Any difficulty breathing should be
                    evaluated by a physician.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Stubborn Cough:
                <p>If you've had a cough that hasn't cleared up after a month or longer, it's considered chronic. It
                    might also be a sign of some kind of respiratory ailment. It's important to talk with a doctor if
                    you have a stubborn, chronic cough.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Breathing Noisily:
                <p>If you are wheezing or breathing noisily, it could be an indication that your airways have become
                    obstructed. It's crucial to address this issue as soon as the first signs emerge.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Lingering Chest Pain:
                <p>If you are having sudden and severe chest pain, you should consider going to the ER right away.
                    However, chest pain can sometimes be mild and lingering. If it lasts for more than a month—and gets
                    worse when you cough or take a deep breath—this is definitely something to tell your doctor about.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Chronic Mucus:
                <p>Mucus is your body's natural defense against infection and other irritants. If you've been coughing
                    up phlegm or feeling drainage in your chest for more than a month, this could be a sign of a
                    respiratory illness.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Coughing Up Blood:
                <p>The blood that escapes in a cough may come from your lungs or respiratory tract. No matter the cause,
                    coughing up blood is serious and you should see your doctor right away.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Are Respiratory Diseases Important?</h2>
        <p>Currently more than 25 million people6, in the United States have asthma. Approximately 14.8 million adults
            have been diagnosed with COPD, and approximately 12 million people have not yet been diagnosed. The burden
            of respiratory diseases affects individuals and their families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities,
            and states. Because of the cost to the health care system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on
            society; it is paid for with tax dollars, higher health insurance rates, and lost productivity. Annual
            health care expenditures for asthma alone are estimated at $20.7 billion.</p>
