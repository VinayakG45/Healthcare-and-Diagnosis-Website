            <div class="content">
                <p>Dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is a branch of medicine that consists of
                    the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the oral
                    cavity (the mouth), commonly in the dentition (development and arrangement of teeth) as well as the
                    oral mucosa, and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in associated
                    maxillofacial (jaw and facial) area.</p>
                <p>The field of dentistry or dental medicine includes teeth as well as other aspects of the craniofacial
                    complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous,
                    vascular, and anatomical structures. The practitioner is called a dentist.</p>
                <p>Dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental
                    auxiliaries (dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, as well as dental
                    therapists).</p>
                <p>Many Indians today enjoy excellent oral health and are keeping their natural teeth throughout their
                    lives. But this is not the case for everyone. Cavities are still the most prevalent chronic disease
                    of childhood.</p>

        <h2>The Dentist's Role</h2>
        <p>Dentists are doctors who specialize in oral health. Their responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diagnosing oral diseases.</li>
            <li>Promoting oral health and disease prevention.</li>
            <li>Creating treatment plans to maintain or restore the oral health of their patients.</li>
            <li>Interpreting x-rays and diagnostic tests.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the safe administration of anesthetics.</li>
            <li>Monitoring growth and development of the teeth and jaws.</li>
            <li>Performing surgical procedures on the teeth, bone and soft tissues of the oral cavity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dentists' oversight of the clinical team is critical to ensuring safe and effective oral care. Even seemingly
            routine procedures such as tooth extractions, preparing and placing fillings or administering anesthetics
            carry potential risks of complications such as infection, temporary or even permanent nerve damage,
            prolonged bleeding, hematomas and pain.</p>

        <h2>Why Oral Health Matters</h2>
        <p>Numerous recent scientific studies indicate associations between oral health and a variety of general health
            conditions â€” including diabetes and heart disease. In response, the World Health Organization has integrated
            oral health into its chronic disease prevention efforts "as the risks to health are linked."</p>
        <p>The Indain Dental Association recommends that dental visits begin no later than a child's first birthday to
            establish a "dental home." Dentists can provide guidance to children and parents, deliver preventive oral
            health services, and diagnose and treat dental disease in its earliest stages. This ongoing dental care will
            help both children and adults maintain optimal oral health throughout their lifetimes.</p>
        <p>Dentists' areas of care include not only their patients' teeth and gums but also the muscles of the head,
            neck and jaw, the tongue, salivary glands, the nervous system of the head and neck and other areas. </p>

        <h2>Improving the Nation's Oral Health</h2>
        <p>Despite all we know about the importance of oral health to overall health, to people's self-esteem and to
            their employability, state and federal policies continually sell dental care short.</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Most states spend 2 percent or less of their Medicaid budgets on dental services.</li>
                <li>An estimated 164 million work hours are lost each year due to oral disease.</li>
            </ul>
