                <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a condition that affects the brain. Alzheimer’s disease is a neurological
                    condition in which the death of brain cells causes memory loss
                    and cognitive decline.</p>
                <p>It is the most common type of dementia, accounting for around 60–80% of cases of dementia in the
                    United States. Alzheimer’s disease affects around 5 million people Source in the U.S. Estimates
                    suggest that this number will nearly triple by 2060.</p>
                <p>The condition usually affects people aged 65 years and over, with only 10% Source of cases occurring
                    in people younger than this.The symptoms are mild at first and become more severe over time. It is
                    named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who first described the condition in 1906.</p>
                <p>One of the main features of the condition is the presence of plaques and tangles in the brain.
                    Another feature is a loss of connection between the nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. Common
                    symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include memory loss, language problems, and impulsive or
                    unpredictable behavior.</p>
            </div>

            <p>These features mean that information cannot pass easily between different areas of the brain or between
                the brain and the muscles or organs. As the symptoms worsen, it becomes harder for people to remember
                recent events, to reason, and to
                recognize people they know. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer’s disease may need full-time assistance.

        <h2>symptoms of Alzheimer's</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition, meaning that the symptoms get worse over time. Memory loss is
            a key feature, and this tends to be one of the first symptoms to develop. The symptoms appear gradually,
            over months or years. If they develop over hours or days, a person may
            require medical attention, as this could indicate a stroke.</p>
        <p>Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Memory loss:</a> A person may have difficulty taking in new information and remembering
                information. This can lead to:
                <ul>
                    <li>repeating questions or conversations</li>
                    <li>losing objects</li>
                    <li>forgetting about events or appointments</li>
                    <li>wandering or getting lost</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><a href="#">Cognitive deficits:</a> A person may experience difficulty with reasoning, complex tasks,
                and judgment. This can lead to:
                <ul>
                    <li>a reduced understanding of safety and risks</li>
                    <li>difficulty with money or paying bills</li>
                    <li>difficulty making decisions</li>
                    <li>difficulty completing tasks that have several stages, such as getting dressed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><a href="#">Problems with recognition:</a> A person may become less able to recognize faces or objects
                or less able to use basic tools. These issues are not due to problems with eyesight.</li>

            <li><a href="#">Problems with spatial awareness:</a> A person may have difficulty with their balance, trip
                over, or spill things more often, or they may have difficulty orienting clothing to their body when
                getting dressed.</li>

            <li><a href="#">Problems with speaking, reading, or writing:</a> A person may develop difficulties with
                thinking of common words, or they may make more speech, spelling, or writing errors.</li>

            <li><a href="#">Personality or behavior changes:</a> A person may experience changes in personality and
                behavior that include:
                <ul>
                    <li>becoming upset, angry, or worried more often than before</li>
                    <li>a loss of interest in or motivation for activities they usually enjoy</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Stages</h2>
        <p>Alzheimer’s disease can range from mild to severe. The scale ranges from a state of mild impairment,
            through to moderate impairment, before eventually reaching severe cognitive decline.</p>

        <h3>Mild Alzheimer’s disease</h3>
        <p>People with mild Alzheimer’s disease develop memory problems and cognitive difficulties that may include the
            following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>taking longer than usual to perform daily tasks</li>
            <li>difficulty handling money or paying the bills</li>
            <li>wandering and getting lost</li>
            <li>experiencing personality and behavior changes, such as getting upset or angry more easily, hiding
                things, or pacing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Moderate Alzheimer’s disease</h3>
        <p>In moderate Alzheimer’s disease, the parts of the brain responsible for language, senses, reasoning, and
            consciousness are damaged. This can lead to the following symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>greater memory loss and confusion</li>
            <li>difficulty recognizing friends or family</li>
            <li>an inability to learn new things</li>
            <li>difficulty performing tasks with several stages, such as getting dressed</li>
            <li>difficulty coping with new situations</li>
            <li>impulsive behavior</li>
            <li>hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Severe Alzheimer’s disease</h3>
        <p>In severe Alzheimer’s disease, plaques and tangles are present throughout the brain, causing the brain tissue
            to shrink substantially. This can lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an inability to communicate</li>
            <li>dependency on others for care</li>
            <li>being unable to leave bed all or most of the time</li>
        </ul>
