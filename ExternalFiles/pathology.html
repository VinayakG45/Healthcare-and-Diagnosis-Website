                <p>Pathology is a branch of medical science primarily concerning the cause, origin and nature of
                    disease. It involves the examination of tissues, organs, bodily fluids and autopsies in order to
                    study and diagnose disease.</p>
                <p>Pathology is the study of the causes and effects of disease or injury. The word pathology also refers
                    to the study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of biology research fields and
                    medical practices.</p>
                <p>Pathology plays a vital role across all facets of medicine throughout our lives, from pre-conception
                    to post mortem. In fact it has been said that "Medicine IS Pathology".</p>
                <p>Pathology is integral to the diagnosis of every cancer.</p>
                <p>Currently, pathology can be divided into eight main areas, depending on the types of methods used or
                    the types of diseases examined. These different disciplines are described below.</p>

        <h3>General pathology</h3>
        <p>General pathology describes a complex and broad field that involves the study of the mechanisms behind cell
            and tissue injury, as well as understanding how the body responds to and repairs injury.</p>
        <p>Examples of areas that may be studied include necrosis, neoplasia, wound healing, inflammation and how cells
            adapt to injury. Thorough understanding in these areas is applied in the diagnosis of disease. General
            pathology is also the term used to describe anatomical and clinical pathology.</p>

        <h3>Anatomical pathology</h3>
        <p>This field is concerned with the study and diagnosis of illness through microscopic analysis of samples from
            bodily fluids, tissues organs and sometimes the entire body or autopsy.</p>
        <p>Factors that may be examined include the cell appearance, anatomical make up and chemical signatures within
            cells. This discipline can be subdivided into several disciplines and examples of these are given below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Histology: Samples of bodily tissues and organs are prepared and examined in order to detect and
                diagnose disease</li>
            <li>Cytology: Bodily fluids and tissues are examined at the cellular level in order to screen for and
                diagnose disease and help aid treatment decisions.</li>
            <li>Forensic pathology: Forensic pathology is the examination of an autopsy in order to discover the cause
                of death. The external appearance is first assessed to check for evidence of wounds or suffocation</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Clinical pathology</h3>
        <p>Also referred to as laboratory medicine, clinical pathology concerns the analysis of blood, urine and tissue
            samples to examine and diagnose disease. Examples of the information clinical pathology laboratories may
            provide include blood count, blood clotting and electrolyte results.</p>
        <p>A clinical pathologist is usually trained in microbiology, hematology or blood banking, but not at the same
            expert level as someone who specializes in one of these fields.</p>


        <h3>Chemical Pathology or Biochemistry</h3>
        <p>Biochemists or chemical pathologists examine all aspects of disease, identifying changes in various different
            substances found in the blood and bodily fluids such as proteins, hormones and electrolytes, since these
            changes can indicate and provide clues about disease or disease risk.</p>
        <p>For example, a biochemist may assess cholesterol and triglyceride levels in order to determine heart disease
            risk. They may also look for and measure tumor markers, vitamins, poisons, medications and recreational
            drugs.</p>

        <h3>Genetics</h3>
        <p>Genetics involves performing tests on chromosomes, biochemical markers and DNA taken from bodily fluids and
            tissues in order to detect genetic illnesses.</p>
        <p>There are three main branches of genetics and these include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cytogenetics: This is the analysis of chromosomal abnormalities at the microscopic level.</li>
            <li>Biochemical genetics: The search for specific disease markers using biochemical techniques.</li>
            <li>Molecular genetics: Gene mutations are searched for and analyzed using DNA technology.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hematology</h3>
        <p>This field is concerned with various different disease aspects that affect the blood, including bleeding
            disorders, clotting problems, and anemia, for example. Another area of hematology is transfusion medicine,
            which involves performing blood typing, cross-matching for compatibility and managing large amounts of blood
            products. An example of a test a hematologist may perform is a blood clotting test to check whether a
            patientâ€™s dose of warfarin needs increasing or decreasing.</p>

        <h3>Microbiology</h3>
        <p>Microbiology is concerned with diseases caused by pathogenic agents such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and
            fungi. Samples of blood, bodily fluid and tissue are tested to establish whether infection exists, and the
            field of medical microbiology is also engaged with identifying new species of microorganisms.</p>

        <p>Other areas encompassed by microbiology include control of infection outbreaks and researching the problems
            resulting from bacterial antibiotic resistance. One of the principal roles of the microbiologist is to make
            sure that antimicrobial drugs are prescribed and used appropriately.</p>
