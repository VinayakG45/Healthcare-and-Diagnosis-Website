                <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels.
                </p>
                <p>It's usually associated with a build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries (atherosclerosis) and
                    an increased risk of blood clots.</p>
                <p>It can also be associated with damage to arteries in organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and
                    eyes. CVD is one of the main causes of death and disability in the UK, but it can often largely be
                    prevented by leading a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                <p>Heart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents
                    blood from flowing to the heart or brain.Strokes can be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in
                    the brain or from blood clots.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="image">

            <p>The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical
                inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up
                in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and
                obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an
                increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.</p>
            <p>There are also a number of underlying determinants of CVDs. These are a reflection of the major forces
                driving social, economic and cultural change – globalization, urbanization and population ageing. Other
                determinants of CVDs include poverty, stress and hereditary factors. In addition, drug treatment of
                hypertension, diabetes and high blood lipids are necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent
                heart attacks and strokes among people with these conditions. </p>
            <p>Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular
                physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of
                cardiovascular disease. Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices
                affordable and available are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.

        <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>coronary heart disease: a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle.</li>
            <li>cerebrovascular disease: a disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain.</li>
            <li>peripheral arterial disease: a disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs;</li>
            <li>rheumatic heart disease: damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by
                streptococcal bacteria.</li>
            <li>congenital heart disease: birth defects that affect the normal development and functioning of the heart
                caused by malformations of the heart structure from birth.</li>
            <li>deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move
                to the heart and lungs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>comman symptoms of cardiovascular diseases</h2>
        <p>Symptoms of heart attack and strokes:</p>
        <p>Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be
            the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest. and/or</li>
            <li>pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; nausea or vomiting;
            light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are more likely than men to have
            shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.</p>

        <p>The most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of
            the body. Other symptoms include sudden onset of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body.</li>
            <li>confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech.</li>
            <li>difficulty seeing with one or both eyes.</li>
            <li>difficulty walking, dizziness and/or loss of balance or coordination.</li>
            <li>severe headache with no known cause.</li>
            <li>fainting or unconsciousness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately.</p>

        <h2>WHO (World Health Organization) response</h2>
        <p>In 2013, WHO Member States agreed on global mechanisms to reduce the avoidable NCD burden including a "Global
            action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020". This Plan aims to reduce the number of
            premature deaths from NCDs by 25% by 2025 through nine voluntary global targets. Two of the targets directly
            focus on preventing and controlling CVDs.</p>
        <p>Target 6: Reduce global prevalence of raised blood pressure by 25% between 2010 and 2025.</p>
        <p>Target 8: At least 50% of eligible people should receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic
            control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes by 2025.</p>
        <p>In addition, target 9 states that there should be 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and
            essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major NCDs in both public and private facilities.
            Achieving these targets will require significant investment in and strengthening of health systems.
            WHO is currently working on increasing the normative guidance available for the management of acute coronary
            syndrome and stroke which will provide guidance in these important areas</p>
