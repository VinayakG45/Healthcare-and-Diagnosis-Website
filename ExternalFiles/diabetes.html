                <p>Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. </p>
                <p>Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made
                    by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p>
                <p>Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then
                    stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>
                <p>Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no
                    cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.</p>
                <p>Sometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or “borderline diabetes.” These terms suggest that
                    someone doesn’t really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is
                    serious.</p>

            <p> Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With
                diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it does
                make.</p>

            <p>Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms of diabetes</h2>
        <p>Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar.The general symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>increased hunger</li>
            <li>increased thirst</li>
            <li>weight loss</li>
            <li>frequent urination</li>
            <li>blurry vision</li>
            <li>extreme fatigue</li>
            <li>sores that don’t heal</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms in men</h2>
        <p>In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have a decreased sex drive, erectile
            dysfunction (ED), and poor muscle strength.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms in women</h2>
        <p>Women with diabetes can also have symptoms such as urinary tract infections, yeast infections, and dry, itchy
            skin.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="extrainfo" id="types">
        <h2>There are a few different types of diabetes:</h2>
        <p>The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.</p>
        <h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your
            immune system attacks and destroys the
            cells in your pancreas that make insulin. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About 10% of people with
            diabetes have this type. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults,
            although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.
        </p>
        <p>Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>extreme hunger</li>
            <li>increased thirst</li>
            <li>unintentional weight loss</li>
            <li>frequent urination</li>
            <li>blurry vision</li>
            <li>tiredness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...it may also result in mood changes.</p>

        <h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
        <p>If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at
            any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older
            people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.</p>

        <p>Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>increased hunger</li>
            <li>increased thirst</li>
            <li>increased urination</li>
            <li>blurry vision</li>
            <li>sores that don’t heal</li>
            <li>tiredness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...it may also cause recurring infections. This is because elevated glucose levels make it harder for the
            body to heal.</p>

        <h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
        <p>Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes
            goes away after the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of
            developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2
            diabetes.</p>
        <p>Most women with gestational diabetes don’t have any symptoms. The condition is often detected during a
            routine blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test that is usually performed between the 24th and 28th
            weeks of gestation.</p>
        <p>In rare cases, a woman with gestational diabetes will also experience increased thirst or urination.</p>

        <h3>Other types of diabetes</h3>
        <p>Less common types include monogenic diabetes, which is an inherited form of diabetes, and cystic
            fibrosis-related diabetes External link.</p>

    <section class="extrainfo" id="cause">

        <h2>Causes of diabetes</h2>
        <p>Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.</p>

        <h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
        <p>Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks
            and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also
            possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.</p>

        <h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese
            increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to
            the effects of insulin on your blood sugar. This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that
            make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.</p>

        <h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
        <p>Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that
            make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar
            during pregnancy. Women who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their
            pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.
        </p>

        <h2>Diabetes risk factors</h2>
        <p>Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes.</p>

        <h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
        <p>You’re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you’re a child or teenager, you have a parent or sibling with
            the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease.</p>

        <h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
        <p>Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>are overweight</li> 
           <li>are age 45 or older</li> 
           <li>have a parent or sibling with the condition</li> 
           <li>aren’t physically active</li> 
           <li>have had gestational diabetes</li>
           <li>have prediabetes</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
        <p>Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are over age 25</li>
            <li>are overweight</li>
            <li>had gestational diabetes during a past pregnancy</li>
            <li>have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds</li>
            <li>have a family history of type 2 diabetes</li>
            <li>have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</li>
        </ul>
