                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
                <p>Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most
                    people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID
                    conditions.</p>
                <p> Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a
                    properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. </p>
                <p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
                    without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical
                    attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease,
                    diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone
                    can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>

            <p>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released
                into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets
                may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and
                accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation.
                This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.</p>

    <section class="extrainfo" id="cause">
        <h2>causes of COVID-19</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus
            strain.</p>

        <h4>Transmission</h4>
        <p>The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne
            particles (that form an aerosol) that infected people exhale as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or
            sing. Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 when they are physically close.
            However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.</p>
        <p>Infectivity can occur 1-3 days before the onset of symptoms.Infected persons can spread the disease even
            if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. Most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory
            tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms
            begin. Current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to
            10 days following symptom onset for persons with mild to moderate COVID-19, and a up to 20 days for persons
            with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons.</p>

        <h4>Virology</h4>
        <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute
            respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur
            in related coronaviruses in nature.</p>
        <p>Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
            SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic)
            origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus
            Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96%
            identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13)</p>

        <h4>SARS-CoV-2 variants</h4>
        <p>The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. The WHO, in
            collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have
            established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain
            and Pango. At the present time, the expert group convened by WHO has recommended the labeling of variants
            using letters of the Greek Alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification
            that they "will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences. Nextstrain
            divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven
            (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR). The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating
            lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.</p>

        <h2>symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate
            illness and recover without hospitalization.</p>

        <h4>Most common symptoms:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>fever</li>
            <li>cough</li>
            <li>tiredness</li>
            <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Less common symptoms:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>sore throat</li>
            <li>headache</li>
            <li>aches and pains</li>
            <li>diarrhoea</li>
            <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
            <li>red or irritated eyes</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Serious symptoms:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
            <li>loss of speech or mobility, or confusion</li>
            <li>chest pain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or
            health facility. People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
            On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it
            can take up to 14 days.</p>

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself & Others</h2>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-band-aid"></i> Get Vaccinated</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Authorized COVID-19 vaccines can help protect you from COVID-19.</li>
            <li>You should get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can.</li>
            <li>Once you are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing
                because of the pandemic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><i class="fas fa-head-side-mask"></i> Wear a mask</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.
            </li>
            <li>People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may not be fully
                protected even if they are fully vaccinated.</li>
            <li>If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly
                spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high
                transmission.</li>
            <li>If you are fully vaccinated, see When You've Been Fully Vaccinated.</li>

        <h4><i class="fas fa-people-arrows"></i> Stay 6 feet away from others</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
            <li>Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don't live in
                your household.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><i class="fas fa-users-slash"></i> Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Being in crowds like in restaurants, bars, fitness centers, or movie theaters puts you at higher risk
